  ![Texto alternativo](VENDING)



In this project we use a Basys 3 to simulate a vending machine, in which you can enter coins of 1, 2, 5 and 10 pesos, you can select between x products and it shows the price in two seven segment displays and the money entered and the change on another two seven segment display. The change in shown after pressing a confirmation button.


In this machine it is not possible to enter more than 99 pesos and if the money inserted is less than the price of the product, it does not accept the purchase and therefore does not show the change.
